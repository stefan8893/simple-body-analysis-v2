# SimpleBodyAnalysis

## What it is

A simple app to track and analyze body data, such as:

- Weight
- Body Fat
- Body Water
- Muscle Mass
- BMI
- Daily Calorie Requirement

Some while ago, I was obese and needed to lose weight.  
So I started a strict diet and lifting weights.  
In order to see the progress, not only in the mirror, I created this app.

## Infrastructure

This app runs entirely in Azure and uses the following resources:

- EntraID (OAuth2.1 + OpenID Connect)
- Azure Blob Storage (static web site hosting)
- Azure Tables (storage for the body data)

There is no backend, the app gets served from the blob storage that is configured to host a static web site.  
After authenticating against EntraID, tokens get issued that can be used to query Azure Tables that contain the actual body data.  

The data itself comes from a SÃ–HNLE Shape Sense scale.  
A csv export of the scale's data gets uploaded to the app(client-side) and parsed there before finally stored in Azure Tables.
